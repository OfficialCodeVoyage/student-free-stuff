# Free software development tools for students

## For all institutions
You can get all of these if you're a student. It helps to have a .edu email address
* [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/) - a huge set of dev tools for most languages/platforms like Java, C#, Obj-C, PHP, Ruby, Python, and Ruby. They have really nice and easy-to-use IDEs like PyCharm and WebStorm that would normally cost a lot of money
* [Autodesk](https://www.autodesk.com/education/free-software/all) - A set of modeling utilities for engineering students.
* [GitHub Student Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) - a bunch of discounted/free stuff you can get due to company tie-ups with GitHub. Get AWS creds, DigitalOcean creds, Stripe discounts, a free .me domain, and lessons from Udacity.
* [Microsoft Imagine](https://imagine.microsoft.com/en-us/catalog) - discounted/free .NET-based technologies like Visual Studio and SQL Server
* [On The Hub](http://onthehub.com/) - search for your school and find software that your school sponsors, often Windows 10 downloads, VMWare, etc.
* [Namecheap](https://nc.me) - get a free .me domain for a year, in addition to heavily discounted other domains. Also comes with free email hosting
* [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/) - Free unlimited digital access with .edu e-mail address


## For most institutions
Your school has probably told you about these already, but here goes anyway
* IEEE Student Membership - A lot of schools give you IEEE memberships, allowing you to view some of the nation's best STEM research work for free, when it would otherwise cost you about $50 per paper.
* MATLAB - a lot of schools, especially engineering colleges, sponsor a university-wide MATLAB license, allowing you to save thousands upon thousands of dollars
* Microsoft Office - most schools sponsor free Microsoft Office for all of their students.
* Google Drive - if your school has an educational Google Apps account, you have infinite storage (technically like 10 TB) on your account. You can save everything to your heart's content on that account.

## For a few institutions
Just a few schools have these
* Free Adobe Creative Cloud - some schools like UC Berkeley and Clemson have tie-ups with Adobe and can provide free Creative Cloud for their students.
